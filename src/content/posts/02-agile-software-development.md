## Overview

Agile software development methodology has gained immense popularity over the years due to its ability to quickly and efficiently produce software. It is a lightweight and flexible approach to software development that focuses on delivering incremental and interactive results through collaboration, adaptive planning, short delivery times and customer feedback.

## What is Agile Software Development

Agile software development is a project management approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development to deliver software products that meet customer needs.

Agile software development eliminates the risk of investing months or years in a development process that may ultimately fail due to minor errors made in the early stages. It depends on placing trust in employees and teams to work closely with customers, comprehend the objectives, and offer solutions quickly and incrementally. Here's a quick summary of how agile software development operates:

1. **Planning and Requirements Gathering**: The team works with the customer to understand the project requirements and create a prioritized backlog of user stories.

2. **Sprint Planning**: The team selects a set of user stories from the backlog for the upcoming sprint and creates a sprint plan. The sprint plan outlines the specific tasks that need to be completed during the sprint.

3. **Development**: The team works on the selected user stories during the sprint, using an iterative development process. This means that the team releases working software at the end of each sprint.

4. **Daily Stand-up Meetings**: The team holds brief daily meetings to discuss progress and any issues that need to be addressed.

5. **Sprint Review**: At the end of each sprint, the team presents the working software to the customer for feedback.

6. **Sprint Retrospective**: The team reflects on the completed sprint and identifies areas for improvement. The team also use this information to adjust their approach for the next sprint.

7. **Repeat**: The team continues to work through the backlog of user stories, selecting and completing them in sprints until the product is complete.

## The 3C's of Agile Software Development

Agile software development is based on the principles of collaboration, customer feedback, and the “three C’s” – card, conversation, and confirmation.

### Card

A card in user stories in Agile is a way of breaking down user stories into smaller, more manageable tasks that can be easily monitored and identified. Each card may include additional information such as priority level or estimated completion date for further support of project management. By breaking down the stories into individual cards, developers can focus on one specific aspect at a time, making tracking progress easier and identifying any potential changes or issues before they become problems during development.

### Conversation

The second C of Agile is a conversation, which emphasizes frequent communication between team members to identify any possible changes or issues before they become problems during development. This involves regularly discussing progress updates with stakeholders and providing feedback for any feature requests or bug reports to ensure the final product meets all quality assurance standards required by the customer.

### Confirmation

Finally, the third C of Agile is confirmation, which allows customers to review and test features before making them available in production environments. This helps to ensure applications are error-free while also giving developers valuable insights into customer preferences so they can make necessary improvements before release.

## Example of Agile Software Development

The most popular and common example of agile software development is Scrum.

> Scrum is a software product development strategy that organizes software developers as a team to reach a common goal — creating a ready-for-market product.

### How Scrum works

- A product owner makes a prioritized wish list known as a product backlog.

- The scrum team takes one small piece of the top of the wish list called a sprint backlog and plans to implement it.

- The team completes their sprint backlog task in a sprint (a 2-4 week period). They assess progress in a meeting called a daily scrum.

- The ScrumMaster keeps the team focused on the goal.

- At the sprint’s end, the work is ready to ship or show. The team closes the sprint with a review, then starts a new sprint.

#### In layman's terms
>
> Grace meets with a customer to discuss her company’s needs. Those needs are the product backlog. Grace chooses the most important tasks to work on in the next two weeks. Her team meets in a daily scrum to target work for the day ahead and address roadblocks. At the end of the sprint, Grace delivers the work, reviews the backlog, and sets the goal for the next sprint. The cycle repeats until the software is complete.

## Benefits of Agile Software Development

The benefits of Agile are tied directly to its faster, lighter, more engaged mindset. The process delivers what the customer wants, when they want it. There’s much less wasted time spent developing in the wrong direction, and the entire system is quicker to respond to changes.

1. **It's Faster**: Speed is one of the biggest benefits of Agile Methodology. A faster software development life cycle means less time between paying and getting paid. That, in turn, means a more profitable business.

2. **Increased customer satisfaction**: With Agile, customers don’t wait for months or years, only to get exactly what they didn’t want. Instead, they get iterations of something very close to what they want, very fast. The system adjusts quickly to refine the successful customer solution, adapting as it goes to changes in the overall environment.

3. **Values employees**: Employees whose ideas are valued are vastly more productive than those who are ordered to follow a set of rules. The Agile Methodology respects employees by giving them the goal, then trusting them to reach it. Since they’re the ones with their hands on the controls and the ones who see the obstacles that crop up every day, employees are in the best position to respond to challenges and meet the goals at hand.

4. **Eliminates rework**: By involving the customer at more than just the phases of requirements and delivery, the project remains on-task and in-tune with customer needs at every step. This means less backtracking and less “out on a limb” time between the time we do the work and the time the customer suggests revisions.

## Best Practices for Agile Software Development

1. **Focus on the customer**: Agile development puts the customer at the center of the development process, so it's important to understand their needs, preferences, and expectations. Regular communication with the customer throughout the development process helps to ensure that the software product meets their
requirements.

2. **Prioritize user stories**: User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature or functionality from the user's perspective. Prioritizing user stories helps the team to focus on the most important features first and to deliver working software more quickly.

3. **Use sprints to manage development**: Sprints are time-boxed periods of development where the team focuses on a specific set of user stories. Using sprints helps the team to manage development in a predictable and controlled way and to deliver working software at regular intervals.

4. **Foster collaboration**: Agile development emphasizes teamwork and collaboration. Encouraging collaboration between team members, including developers, testers, and business analysts, helps to ensure that everyone is working towards a common goal.

5. **Embrace change**: Agile development recognizes that change is inevitable and that requirements may evolve throughout the development process. Embracing change and being flexible allows the team to adapt to new requirements and to deliver software that meets the customer's changing needs.

6. **Continuously improve**: Agile development is a continuous improvement process, so it's important to regularly reflect on the development process and identify areas for improvement. This helps the team to become more efficient and effective in delivering working software.
